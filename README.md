# PCC_LUT_SR
Fractional look-up table based super resolution for point clouds coded with octree on TMC13 (MPEG-GPCC).

This is a super resolution solution for post-processing decoded point clouds, whose geometry has been encoded with octree under TMC13. 
Please, refer to file run_SR.sh as an example. The user must set-up the correct folders and input parameters.
